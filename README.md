# final-project
 This was my final project for The Iron Yard, I created an application that would find your location and use it to      find a CrossFit that allow drop ins to their gym. In that app I connected to the Yelp API and got the ratings for each gym as well as their contact information, while displaying it using the Google API. I also included a feature where you could pay for your drop in using Stripe Checkout.
